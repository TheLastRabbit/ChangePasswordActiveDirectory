# ChangePasswordActiveDirectory

1 - I have created this page because, we have many domains in our company and when a user forget his password. He just need to input his mail in the first screen and then click in the token that will come into his mail address. And then the page that appears he can change his password without input the old one.

2 - This is only the 1.0 version. Many things need to be corrected. 

3 - Thank you once more for your support :).
